An AI voice assistant that talks to students after lectures and turns their feedback into public reviews. Students speak naturally about their experience, and the AI automatically extracts ratings and insights to help other students choose courses.
Built with: React, ElevenLabs (voice), OpenAI (conversation AI)
Solves: Low survey completion rates by making feedback feel like talking to a friend instead of filling out a form.
